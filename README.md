# Fitness Tracker
A fitness tracker which allows users to create a user name, and then add fitness statistics to their profile.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, Mongo DB

This was built using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, Mongo DB. 

## Optimizations

If I had more time, I would create a login system for the users, in order to keep their fitness data private. I would also include a data system which could convert into a data display, showing progress over time for the users. 

## Lessons Learned:

The importance of having a clear data structure before coding an app was apparent, as any additions or changes required throughout meant editing all of the edisting data and related API handlers. 

I also learned that it is important to push to the hosting environment in the early stages of a project. I pushed the project to Heroku near the end of the project and there were some bugs, these bugs were tricky to find but would have been easier to trace if I had tested after each new feature add.
